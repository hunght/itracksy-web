You can apply for funding to reduce costs here: https://foundershub.startups.microsoft.com/

1️⃣ Important factors when applying for funding:
First, you must meet the requirements for each Level. For example:

- L1 requires a verified LinkedIn profile and product idea
- L2 requires a business license
- L3+ requires a website, demo video, etc.
  For example, we introduce our product briefly as “Lazy Prompter is an AI prompt generator. It is a creative assistant that supports everyone from marketers, creators, to businesses when they run out of ideas… In just a few seconds, the tool can create diverse and optimized prompts for images, text… In the future, it will expand to prompts for audio, video…” to demonstrate the product's development potential.
  In addition to the above factors, Microsoft is also very interested in the current level of understanding/application of Azure by the business. Our team is young and has no experience with Azure, and most of us are from a Business background. That is why, although I prepared all the documents for L3, we currently only receive L2 support.

2️⃣ Some notes about the levels:
Level 1-2:
No Azure usage constraints, just use it up before the 12-month deadline.
You can apply to extend, remember to submit at least 2 weeks in advance to avoid interruptions.
Level 3 and above:
Engagement score: Microsoft will monitor your Azure usage to evaluate. Therefore, you cannot apply for additional credits yourself – they will automatically review 45 days before the stage expires.
Credits increase through the stages (L1-L4) and up to a maximum of $150,000. Specifically:
L1: $1,000
L2: $5,000
L3: $25,000
L4: $150,000
Small note: If you have received $5,000 at L2, when you move to L3, you will only receive an additional $20,000.

3️⃣ Some things to remember:
