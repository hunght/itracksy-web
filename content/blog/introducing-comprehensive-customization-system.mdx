# Make iTracksy Yours: Introducing Comprehensive Customization System

We believe productivity tools should adapt to **you**, not the other way around. That's why we're thrilled to introduce our comprehensive customization system that puts you in complete control of your iTracksy experience.

## 🎨 Why Customization Matters

Everyone works differently. Some prefer large fonts for comfort during long sessions. Others want a minimal interface to eliminate distractions. Some need accessibility features, while others want vibrant colors for energy.

**Your workspace should reflect your needs.**

With our new customization system, you can tailor every aspect of iTracksy to match your workflow, preferences, and accessibility requirements.

Hide features you use less than once per week. You can always show them again later.
