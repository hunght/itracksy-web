🚀 Product Update: Advanced Task Management in Itracksy

We're excited to announce four powerful new features designed to help teams and individuals plan better and execute faster:

1️⃣ DEADLINE COUNTDOWNS
See exactly how much time remains for each task with smart color-coding:
• Red: Overdue (immediate action needed)
• Orange: Due today
• Yellow: Due within 3 days
• Gray: Future deadlines

2️⃣ INTELLIGENT TIME ESTIMATES
Set estimated time for any task (e.g., "2h 30m"). When you start a focus session, the timer automatically uses your estimate. No manual adjustments needed.

This transforms planning from guesswork into data-driven decisions.

3️⃣ SUBTASK TRACKING
Break down complex projects into manageable steps:
• Create unlimited subtasks
• Check off completed items
• See real-time progress: "40% - 2/5 completed"

Perfect for multi-phase projects, onboarding, and process workflows.

4️⃣ COLUMN METRICS
Each kanban column now displays:
• Total card count
• Sum of estimated hours
• Example: "6 cards | Est: 10.5h"

Sprint planning and capacity management just became effortless.

💡 REAL-WORLD IMPACT:

For development teams: Plan sprints with accurate capacity data
For freelancers: Never miss a client deadline
For content creators: Ship on schedule, every time

These features are available now in the latest version of Itracksy. All existing data remains unchanged, and the new features are completely optional.

### Reddit Post (r/productivity, r/SideProject)

**Title:** I added deadline countdowns, time estimates, and subtasks to my time tracking app

**Body:**
```
Hey r/productivity! 👋

I've been building Itracksy (a time tracking and focus app) and just shipped a major update based on community feedback.

**What's new:**

🎯 **Deadline Countdowns**
Tasks now show "Due: Oct 10 (in 8 days)" with color coding for urgency. Makes it instantly clear what needs attention.

⏱️ **Smart Time Estimates**
Set how long a task should take. When you start a focus session, timer auto-sets to that duration. Game changer for planning realistic workdays.

✅ **Subtasks**
Break down complex work into checkable steps. Cards show progress like "40% - 2/5 completed".

📊 **Column Metrics**
Kanban columns display card count + total estimated hours. Perfect for sprint planning: "8 cards | Est: 16h"

**Why I built this:**

I kept finding myself:
- Missing deadlines I'd forgotten about
- Starting timers and guessing at duration
- Feeling overwhelmed by large tasks
- Having no idea if my sprint planning was realistic

These features solve all of that.

**Technical details:**
- Electron app (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Local-first with SQLite
- Auto time tracking
- Privacy-focused (no cloud sync by default)

The update is live now. If you're already using it, just restart to apply the migration.
