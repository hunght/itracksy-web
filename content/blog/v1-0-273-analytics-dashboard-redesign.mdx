## What's New

### 1. Three-Layer Progressive Disclosure Analytics

We've completely redesigned the Analytics Dashboard based on the principle of **Progressive Disclosure** - showing you the right level of detail at the right time.

#### Layer 1: The Pulse (Instant Feedback)

The new **Focus Score** gives you immediate feedback on your productivity:

- **Single number (0-100)** that tells you how your day is going
- **Visual ring** showing progress at a glance
- **Status labels**: Deep Work, Productive, Distracted, or Recovering
- **Quick stats**: Focus Time, Productivity %, Sessions count

*The Focus Score is calculated from both your productivity percentage AND total focus time - rewarding both quality and quantity.*

#### Layer 2: Day Review (Tactical Insight)

Get a deeper understanding of your day with:

- **Activity Timeline**: Gantt-style visualization of your work blocks
- **Top Apps**: See which applications consumed your time
- **Time by Project**: Horizontal bar chart showing project breakdown
- **Activity Heatmap**: GitHub-style contribution graph

#### Layer 3: Deep Dive (Strategic Analysis)

For those who want to optimize their productivity long-term:

- **Focus Trends**: Line chart with 7-day moving average
- **Peak Hours Analysis**: Discover your most productive hours
- **Productivity Insights**: AI-powered recommendations

---

### 2. Peak Hours Analysis

**Discover when you do your best work!**

The new Peak Hours Analysis feature identifies:

- **Your top 3 productive hours** based on historical data
- **Work style classification**: Early Bird, Afternoon Focused, Evening Worker, Night Owl, or Balanced
- **Time of day distribution**: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night percentages
- **Hourly breakdown chart**: Visual representation of your work patterns

*Use this data to schedule important tasks during your peak performance hours!*

---

### 3. AI-Powered Productivity Insights

![Productivity Insights](/blog/productivity-insights.png)

Get actionable recommendations based on your actual work patterns:

| Insight Type | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| **Success** | "You're improving! Focus time increased compared to last week" |
| **Warning** | "Short sessions detected - try the Pomodoro technique" |
| **Tip** | "20% of your work is late at night - this may affect sleep" |

Insights are automatically generated based on:
- Session length patterns
- Productivity percentages
- Time trends (comparing recent vs past performance)
- Work hour distribution

---

### 4. Seamless Task Switching

**No more error messages when switching tasks!**

Previously, trying to start a new task while one was running showed an error. Now you get a friendly confirmation dialog:

- **"Switch Task?"** - Clear confirmation dialog
- **One-click switch**: Stop current task and start new one automatically
- **Cancel option**: Keep working on current task if you clicked by accident

This makes task switching much smoother when jumping between projects!

---

### 5. Improved Unlimited Focus Mode

For unlimited focus sessions, we now show:

- **Simple "Tracking" indicator** instead of a counting timer
- **Pulsing animation** to show the session is active
- **"Your activities are being recorded"** message

*Because showing elapsed time doesn't make sense when there's no target!*

---

## Design Philosophy

This redesign follows key UX principles:

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show simple data first, details on demand
2. **Empowerment Metrics**: Focus on growth and improvement, not surveillance
3. **Reduce Complexity**: Fewer clicks, clearer visualizations
4. **Actionable Insights**: Every chart should answer "So what?" and "Now what?"

---

## Other Improvements

- **Simplified Reports Page**: Cleaner table, inline filters
- **Simplified Kanban Board**: Streamlined task management
- **GitHub-style Heatmap**: Proper days-as-rows, weeks-as-columns layout
- **Responsive Design**: All new components work great on different screen sizes
