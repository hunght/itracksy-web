In short, this app helps users in tracking and categorizing activities in a certain period while working, studying, playing or just casually browsing the internet.

Rize does a great job by generating detailed insights on how time was spent in order to give users more understanding, thus improving focus and productivity. Also, it is possible to set up notifications with custom rules to ensure 100% focus of users as well as create more effective work habits.

Apparently, everyone understand that it is always better to give focus to only one task at a time with the aim to create continuous time blocks, hence shortening the time required to complete a task while also improving the results. This is also an idea from Carl Newport's "Deep Work", a great book if someone is facing troubles in maintaining concentration.

That being said, the modern world does not allow that easily as distractions are everywhere from social media sites, online communities to message notifications. So, learning to understand the work behavior and striving to enhance it is critical to succeed.

In that case, the 'track' feature follows users to see what they do, open, use on computer in a day. Now, with the data gathered, reports on time spent, categories used, websites opened, main actions, etc. during different time periods are 'analyzed' and presented to users. Also, those numbers are computed to create suitable notifications on break, idle, interrupting time to keep users 'focus'.

As a result, productivity will surely go up without people noticing.

Besides, some extra features of Rize time tracking app make working easier and less time-consuming. They are, for example, integrations with other apps like emails, messaging and project arrangement into matching sections like study, business management, work, and so much more.

That is the end of the basic intro to Rize and the next section talks about the time tracking app's pros and cons.

## Advantages And Disadvantages Of Rize

![A screenshot inside of Rize time tracking app](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddybeep-7dcf3.appspot.com/o/a-screen-of-rize-time-tracker.png-1742207906799?alt=media&token=b534a8b6-e870-4384-8271-279110ee53b3)As usual, strengths will be listed first and then weaknesses. The content in this part is gathered through different application review sites and communities.

### The Good Aspects Of Rize Productivity Tracker

When it comes to Rize, the first thing that people usually mention is **the excellent UI**. It is really beautiful with a futuristic sense while still being a minimalist and user-friendly. Even the time reports generated by Rize are cool-looking.

The next thing is the **personalization**. Users can freely customize how Rize works to suit their preferences. Despite that, the time tracking software still offers some presets of different strategies on time management to simplify the settings.

Other great abilities found in Rize are **context switching** and focus **tracking.** When being utilized effectively, these two features boost productivity immensely. Of course, this time tracking software provides **concise and to-the-point guides** on how to get the best out of it.

Now, it is time for the most important characteristic which makes Rize so outstanding and it is the **focus on individual use**. Unlike other Rize alternatives like Toggl and Clockify, Rize solely concentrates on serve single users as it allows plug and use. It means that users just turn the app on, start time tracker and forget about everything else as Rize pretty takes care of the rest.

Also, it is possible to see that Rize has a strong userbase and this is thanks to the team's clever marketing tactics. Some might not consider this a strength, but in fact, it proves that **the creators of this time tracking software are very good and can make the app grow bigger**.

Regarding the pricing, Rize supports students and non-profit personnel with a 50% discount, so this kindness surely gives the application a plus point.

Okay, so that pretty wraps up all the strongest sides of Rize. Coming up next is what the time tracking app does not do so well.

### The Critical Reasons Why Rize Alternative Rises

First thing first, the Rize time tracking app functions well on the ground levels and what does this mean? **When looking at the details, many users have spotted that inaccuracies start appearing**, for example, Rize classifies an action as A, but in fact, people use that for B. Categorizing activities is extremely complex and it seems like no AI models are capable of doing so precisely.

Still, Rize offers a solution for this as users are allowed to set custom rules for their actions. Here is an easy example: I am a social media manager and Rize might automatically set Facebook, Instagram or X as "entertainment", but it is possible to switch them to "work" or whatever suitable.

Now, from this, there goes another problem. Somehow the Rize team is constantly **pushing unnecessary AI-related features**, which does not only make the **time tracking app heavier to run**, but also **worsens the user experience**.

Furthermore, as mentioned above, Rize does best in serving individuals and this is obviously good, but **if it comes to a time tracking software for teams, then a big no goes to Rize**. In reality, the application includes time tracker for work hours under "Clients" and "Projects", but they are weak, hard-to-use and lacks lots of features to support teams.

As a result, when it comes to vital time reporting for clients, some worth using options are iTracksy or Toggl.

Last but not least, and possibly the most popular complaint about Rize is the pricing. This time tracking software can be considered as **one of the most expensive** **apps for time management** out there. In case of looking for a cost-effective, compatible with team's use and detailed reporting software, Rize app alternative like **iTracksy** proves to be a good choice.

Oh, **Rize does not have a web app version** as well and this is a small minus point.

Alright, this is also the end of Rize's strengths and weaknesses. If the things listed above are not persuasive enough, then there are many reviews available to check, just Google them.

Next is the part which everyone waits for and **here it comes the best Rize alternative in 2025**.
