[Clockify](https://clockify.me/) has garnered a large user base, particularly among freelancers and small teams. Its promise of a truly free plan with unlimited users is a major draw. But like any software, it has its pros and cons.

Before meeting the Clockify alternative, let's go through the app first to determine if it is worth considering a change.

### **Strengths**

One of Clockify's biggest strengths is its generous [free plan](https://clockify.me/pricing). It allows unlimited users and projects, making it a cost-effective solution for teams. It also offers detailed reporting, project budgeting, and a wide range of integrations with other productivity tools.

Therefore, if someone is seeking a simple timesheet software with a strong free offering, Clockify is often a top recommendation.

### **Weaknesses**

While feature-rich, [Clockify's interface](https://connecteam.com/reviews/clockify/) can sometimes feel a bit cluttered or less intuitive for some users. Navigating through the various sections and customizing reports might require a bit of a learning curve. This creates a major drawback as a time tracking app does not require you to spend unnecessary time on it.

Additionally, while the free plan is extensive, customer support for free users can be limited. Some users looking for a more streamlined or visually appealing experience might seek a Clockify alternative.
