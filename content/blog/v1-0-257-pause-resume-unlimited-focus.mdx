# New Release v1.0.257: Pause Your Focus Sessions & Enhanced Unlimited Tracking

We're excited to announce **iTracksy v1.0.257** with highly requested features that make your productivity tracking more flexible than ever!

## What's New

### 1. Manual Pause & Resume for Focus Sessions

**Finally, you can pause your focus sessions!**

We heard your feedback - sometimes you need to step away briefly without ending your entire session. Now you have full control:

*New pause button lets you take breaks without losing your session progress*

#### How It Works

- **PAUSE**: Click to pause your session when you need a quick break
- **RESUME**: Continue right where you left off
- **Time Excluded**: Paused time is automatically excluded from your session duration
- **Visual Indicator**: Clear "PAUSED" indicator shows when your session is on hold

#### Key Benefits

- Take urgent calls without ending your focus session
- Handle quick interruptions gracefully
- Your productivity stats remain accurate - paused time doesn't count
- Works for both Focus and Break sessions

### 2. Redesigned Unlimited Focus Mode

**Track your work all day, effortlessly.**

We've completely redesigned the Unlimited Focus mode to make it more visible and easier to use:

*Clear mode selector: Choose between Timed sessions or Unlimited tracking*

#### New Mode Selector

Instead of a small toggle, you now have two clear options:

- **Timed** - Set a specific duration for your focus session
- **Unlimited** - Track continuously throughout the day

#### Continuous Background Tracking

When you select Unlimited mode, you'll see a helpful description explaining:

- Runs silently in the background
- Auto-starts with app if enabled in System Settings
- Tracks all your activities throughout the day
- Stop manually when you're done working

**Perfect for:**
- Remote workers who want to track their entire workday
- Freelancers billing by the hour
- Anyone who wants automatic time tracking without managing sessions

---

### 3. Improved UI & User Experience

#### Cleaner Action Buttons

We've streamlined the active session buttons:

- **+5 MIN** - Extend your session (hidden for unlimited sessions)
- **PAUSE** - New pause/resume toggle
- **STOP** - End your session

Removed the redundant CLOCK button for a cleaner interface.

#### Break Sessions Update

- Removed "Unlimited" option for breaks (it didn't make sense - breaks should have a duration!)
- More compact, consistent design matching the Focus tab
- Maximum break duration reduced to 1 hour for practicality

### 4. Theme & Appearance Fixes

![Dark Mode Settings](/blog/dark-mode-settings.png)
*Beautiful dark mode with all theme options working correctly*

- Fixed theme variants now applying correctly
- Light/Dark mode switching works seamlessly
- All color themes (Ocean, Forest, Lavender, Sunset, Rose, Monochrome) now function properly
