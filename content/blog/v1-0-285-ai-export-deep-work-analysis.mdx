# New Release v1.0.285: AI Export for Deep Work Analysis

We're excited to announce **iTracksy v1.0.285** featuring a powerful new **AI Export** capability that transforms your productivity data into structured insights perfect for AI-powered analysis!

---

## The Problem: Invisible Productivity Killers

Research shows that **context switching** is one of the biggest threats to deep work. According to studies:

- It takes an average of **23 minutes** to fully regain focus after an interruption
- Working in a state of constant switching can lower functional IQ by **10-15 points**
- Knowledge workers spend their days jumping between apps, creating fragmented workflows

But until now, you couldn't easily quantify these patterns or get AI help analyzing them.

## What's New: AI Export for Deep Work Analysis

### Access the Feature

Navigate to **Reports** and click the new **AI Export** button with the purple brain icon.

### Choose Your Export Type

| Export Type | Best For | File Size |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Compact** | LLM context windows, quick analysis | Smaller |
| **Full** | Detailed investigation, data science | Larger |

The **Compact** mode omits individual activity logs while keeping all computed metrics - perfect for pasting into ChatGPT, Claude, or other AI assistants.

## What Gets Exported

### Context Switch Detection

Every time you switch between apps, we detect and classify it:

| Switch Type | Description | Cognitive Impact |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Macro** | Different app types (IDE to Zoom) | High |
| **Micro** | Quick switch under 30 seconds | Low |
| **Tab** | Browser tab cycling | Variable |
| **Interruption** | Switch to Slack, Teams, etc. | High |

### Focus Streaks

We identify continuous time blocks in the same app (threshold: 5+ minutes). Your longest focus streak tells you when you achieved true deep work.

### Session Metrics

For each focus session:

- **Productivity Score** (0-100)
- **Context Switch Count**
- **Longest Focus Streak**
- **Unique Apps Used**
- **Average Activity Duration**

### Daily Stats

Aggregated insights for trend analysis:

- **Deep Work Blocks**: Sessions over 25min with fewer than 3 macro switches
- **Total Context Switches**
- **Top Apps by Duration**
- **Top Categories**
- **Productivity Score**

## Sample AI Prompts

Once you have your export, try these prompts with your favorite AI assistant:

### Pattern Analysis
> "Analyze my deep work patterns and identify when I'm most productive. Here's my data: [paste JSON]"

### Context Switching Audit
> "What are my biggest context switching triggers and how can I reduce them? Here's my productivity data: [paste JSON]"

### Weekly Review
> "Compare my productivity across different days and suggest improvements based on this data: [paste JSON]"

### Flow State Investigation
> "Identify my focus streaks and what apps help me stay in flow state. Data: [paste JSON]"

### Personalized Recommendations
> "Based on my work patterns, create a daily schedule that maximizes my deep work time: [paste JSON]"

## Why This Matters

Traditional time tracking tells you *what* you did. AI Export tells you *how* you worked.

With this data, AI can help you:

1. **Identify patterns** you can't see yourself
2. **Quantify the cost** of interruptions
3. **Optimize your schedule** based on actual data
4. **Track improvement** over time
5. **Make evidence-based changes** to your workflow

---

## The Science Behind It

This feature is built on research from:

- **Cal Newport's Deep Work**: Sustained focus creates new value
- **Sophie Leroy's Attention Residue**: Switching leaves cognitive debris
- **Gloria Mark's Interruption Studies**: 23-minute recovery time finding

We've turned these insights into measurable metrics you can act on.

---

## How to Get Started

1. **Track normally** for at least a week
2. Go to **Reports > AI Export**
3. Select your date range
4. Choose **Compact** for AI chat, **Full** for detailed analysis
5. Click **Generate Export**
6. Download JSON or copy to clipboard
7. Paste into your AI assistant with one of the prompts above
