Alright, that pretty wraps up the basics of Toggl and it sounds so good, we all have to agree with that. So, why are people still look for Toggl alternative? The reasons will be presented in the following two parts, pros and cons of Toggl time tracker.

## Advantages Of Toggl Time Track

![Toggl Track features are shown in a computer screen](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddybeep-7dcf3.appspot.com/o/a-screen-showing-toggl-features.png-1742208359471?alt=media&token=be610208-734f-48b6-8cf6-a76f84936ed6)To ensure the objectiveness, this will be like a compilation of Toggl time tracker's reviews on different sites. Only the most prominent and accepted comments by the majority will be taken.

### Powerful Time Tracker

Since Toggl is a time tracking software, people expect the most from this aspect, obviously. And, the application does a really good job.

New users will have no difficulties in learning how to use that as the time tracker is really simple. Moreover, luckily, this essential feature is available to use even on a free plan.

Accompanying it, users are able to generate accurate invoices which is especially helpful for freelance workers. Besides, the Pomodoro timer option and the idle detector are perfect for enhancing focus.

### Wide Range Of Supported Platforms

This characteristic was mentioned above, but this is really important for a tool like Toggle time tracker. How so? Because Toggl time track provides the ability to sync across devices, thus signifying the importance of cross-platform support.

### Friendliness To Users

Really, Toggl's interface is intuitive, direct and allows easy navigation. From easy tasks like tracking time to complex ones like project, team management, the application makes it simple for new users to get acquainted.

## Disadvantages Of Toggl Time Tracker

However, it is purely what regular users expect such an app to do and it just delivers.

So, in this section, the tool's cons are discussed deeper as a way to highlight the needs for a Toggl track alternative.

### Problems with syncing

While Toggl adapts to many platforms and that is appreciated, it creates some problems. The application allows offline time tracking and when you want to get the data during that period on another device, internet connection is required.

If you are on Wi-fi all the time, this should not be an issue. However, for someone having to work offline most of the time, this is an obstacle.

For example, you work at home, on computer A with no internet access and turn on Toggl, then you go to work. Now, you are using computer B and the boss asks for time data on your home work, there will be nothing to show.

Another thing is that connection might sometimes drop and you are certain that the data has been synced. But, in fact, it is not.

### Tracking By Hand

Despite being a time tracker, users still have to press button to start it. This will be a problem if a person is new to the application and has not developed a habit yet. It might not harm in terms of personal use, but in a company setting, this might create troubles for team members.

Also, this makes the billing process of freelancers inaccurately. So, is there a solution to this?

The answer is yes, the browser extension version of Toggl time tracker automatically logs hours once you open a new tab. However, this is much like a temporary way because many people complained that this gets annoying over time. Undeniably, you do not want Toggl to track personal, unwanted websites and actions.

Additionally, another workaround is to start looking up for a Toggl alternative.

### The Lack In Project Management

Toggl offers project management tool called Toggl Plan, but it seems to be like a never-finished product. Users are allowed to manage different projects at once, but everything gets messy once the complexity of programs increase.

This might not seem critical, but it is indeed a huge obstacle when your team is trying to scale up. Time entries, tasks, members will confuse the workspace owners once they are tangled.

For many people, this is acceptable because the nature of Toggl is time tracker. However, when trying to find a good solution for both productivity and project management, there are Toggl alternatives that can do better.

### The Design Of Notifications

Toggl users say that the application sometimes appears to care too much for them because of the excessive notifications. Reviews even use the word "overload" when talking about the tool.

If you forget to start the tracker, you get a notification. If you decide to take a bit of time off during work to rest, you get a notification. There are many other examples like that.

Receiving this during work might be fine for some people, but it is truly irritated when being on a vacation or leave. Also, constant notifications can disrupt the concentration.

### Slow Customer Support

People have mentioned that they cannot get on time, particularly when they need it the most. Imagine that you face a critical error which makes Toggl not working and you will have to wait 1-2 days for a customer helper to reply.

Many users said that they gave up on Toggl because there was no support in a case like that.

### Pricing

It is understandable that pricing is not always an issue. Yet, Toggl's fees are not so affordable for many people. Here are the tiers:

- Free
- Starter plan: $9/month for 1 user
- Premium plan: $18/month for 1 user
- Enterprise plan: contact for pricing

Paying 9 bucks a month is not ideal, especially for users coming from lower-income regions. Moreover, all Toggl's plans are billed annually which means that once you decide to pay, you must stick to it for the rest of the year. Even if you drop after 1 month, you still have paid for the remaining 11 months.

The lack of flexibility and high amount in pricing are also reasons that make people turn to Toggl track free alternative.

## Toggl Alternatives And Their Characteristics

![Three women are happy after getting a good Toggl alternative](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddybeep-7dcf3.appspot.com/o/employees-happy-with-toggl-alternative.jpg-1742208510305.jpeg?alt=media&token=f29a31ae-8a12-4a58-a025-66f80d5f797f)Here we are at the main part of this article. The top 5 tools that prove to be great alternatives to Toggl will be introduced below. They include Toggl alternative open source, Toggl track free alternative and paid ones.

### iTracksy

![The screen of iTracksy, a viable Toggl alternative](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddybeep-7dcf3.appspot.com/o/break.png-1742208530279?alt=media&token=60c8909b-be0d-42e7-b0e2-0bf5c171934c)iTracksy is a new player to the game of productivity tracker, but it does not disappoint. The time tracking app functions well in terms of the main mission with an easy-to-use, well-designed interface and navigation.

Besides the time tracker with a complete breakdown of application domain, usage, title and categories to help in reviewing, project management is also a strength. It features a project management tab inspired by Trello as the main components are columns (to separate sections) and cards (to separate tasks). Furthermore, it lets users track the time of each card.

Given those abilities, team owners are provided with data to dive into the performance of each members. Meanwhile for freelance employees, this makes invoicing much more comfortable with concrete proofs.

Additionally, iTracksy also does not miss features like syncing across platforms as well as integrating multiple strategies on time management to choose from.

Along with that, the application offers generous plans that make it a great fit for a Toggl track free alternative.

However, the only current disadvantage is that iTracksy might lack fancy features and utilities. This aspect can be accepted given that it is new with many room for growth and potential.

### Rize

In terms of popularity, Rize can be considered to lie in the same level as Toggl, yet it does not seem to be a good Toggl alternative. The reasons for that are many.

In terms of features, Rize is not so different from Toggl. The thing separating these two is that Rize can track particular activities. Also, it offers more features than Toggl time tracker, but users are complaining that the application is currently too stuffed with unnecessary things.

Unfortunately, that leads to two other problems. Firstly, with too much features appearing at one time, the interface of Rize is overwhelmed, hence causing troubles for newcomvers and pushing the learning curve higher. Secondly, those unwanted features make Rize's prices going up.

It is indeed true as Rize is more expensive while the free plan is not as good as Toggl. Still, this tool makes it this list thanks to the popularity and stable number of users with the main contribution from nicely done marketing tactics.

Therefore, if someone is looking for a Toggl alternative free, then Rize is not a viable option.

### Clockify

Clockify is also a huge player in the time tracking software field. It does not lack any necessary features and is really fine-tuned for teams' uses.

The free plan of Clockify is extremely generous compared to Toggl time tracker and Rize. For personal use, Cloclify is a good choice.

Yet, as mentioned above, Clockify suits teams better. Its features are mostly designed for companies, so for individuals, there will be many unnecessary things.

That being said, Clockify is quite pricey as the cheapest option is $4/month per seat, so for a team of 4 people, $16 is the cost for each month. Obviously, when it is time to scale, the budgets needed will skyrocket.

So, if it is for personal use, Clockify is not a good selection as a Toggl track free alternative. On the other hand, it can be considered for teams if the owners are ready to pay.

### Activity Watch

This tool might be the only Toggl alternative open source option. So, since it is public, no money is needed and this might be the only strength of Activity Watch.

Being open source brings benefits along with disadvantages for Activity Watch. Still, it is really appreciated as the creator decided to make this available to everyone.

Coming to the weaknesses, this application is really hard to install and use, especially for non-tech people. UI and UX of Activity Watch are also badly designed as they look boring and quite messy at times. Furthermore, as the name implies, it only tracks time and activity, there are no other features.

In terms of being a Toggl alternative free option, Activity Watch is not recommended. However, developers might like it because the open source nature allows customizing and editing to their liking.

### ClickUp

Another very popular name is here. ClickUp has been a giant in productivity and it is even bigger than Toggl time tracker.

But, it is not really a Toggl track alternative. The reason is because ClickUp focuses more on project management and time tracking is not the main feature.

So, when it comes to an application specializing in time tracking, ClickUp is not what comes to people's minds. Still, the tool knows its weaknesses well, so it is possible to integrate Toggl time track into it.

Being a project management tool, ClickUp is loved by teams, not individuals. So, as a Toggl alternative for personal use, it is not so worth it.

## Final Thoughts

Toggl time tracker has been popular and liked by people, that is undeniable. The tools offers solid tracking, project management and great UI/UX. Yet, there might be better options that serve as a great Toggl alternative.

Whether it is a Toggl alternative free solution or open source, a wide range of selections is available. A recommendation is iTracksy, a time tracking software with all the needed features, potential for growth, productivity enhancement abilities and free pricing.

Actions speak louder than words, have a taste of iTracksy now and benefit from it.
