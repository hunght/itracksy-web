During a task or project, when having an app for time management, people are able to see the amount of time spent to complete. Through that, ineffective areas and processes are easily identified. Also, distractive things can be seen.

From here, solutions will be created. Maybe social media, irrelevant websites should be blocked to ensure 100% concentration. Maybe a particular action is taking more time than expected and it needs to be shortened, simplified or adjusted.

Besides, time tracking app that allows goals setting helps with motivation, thus levelling up the efficiency. When combining this with a self-reflection on performance regularly, the positive effects on productivity will surely follow.

### Assist In Project Management

The important thing is that you do not have to switch to another software, since it works like an upgraded Trello alternative.

Commonly, this will be popular for freelancers, specifically remote ones. When clients or employers ask for hourly rates and evidences, it becomes much easier because invoices can be generated.

While traditional time tracking apps do not include this feature since they are created for personal use. It is possible to find a bill generator incorporated in a Toggle or a free Toggl alternative, iTracksy (if you do not want to use all the money received for subscription).

Moreover, a owners are searching for time tracking software for small business as a way to embrace the new trend, remote working. Yet, it is essential to understand that using an app like that does not equal to micro management or controlling, since the aim is primarily to enhance the productivity.

Last but not least, this removes the fear of cheating. This is not a popular case, but some people might report that a task takes 10 hours to do while in fact, it is finished in 2 hours only with the aim to get 5x the money.

### Elevate Strategies On Time Management

Nowadays, methods like Pomodoro, time boxing, <span style="color: rgb(19, 19, 19)">Eisenhower matrix, etc. are being widely applied because they are effective to many people. However, sometimes, it is difficult to commit to them and the reasons are many.</span>

Management people, project managers surely love them since they are equipped with insights on how to improve productivity for the next times. For example, flaws in work processes and flows can be easily detected or even hiring decisions can be made if overloads are detected.

This does not benefit companies only. Even when you are a solo worker or freelancer, having the data to back for your decisions on productivity is mostly welcomed too.
