### Features That Cannot Go Missing In A Hour Tracking App

Obviously, a basic remote worker time tracker **must include hour logging, report and analytics generation and invoice creation**. It is recommended to keep in mind that not every time tracking software are meant for freelancers, thus not having invoice generation or other needed features.

Make sure that the **report can be exported under different time periods, criteria and formats**.

The creators should be actively listen to feedbacks, willing to adapt, change and provide timely support. That acts as a guarantee for time tracking software to continue being developed in the future.
